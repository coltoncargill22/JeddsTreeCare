  <h2>Emerald Ash Borer Identification</h2>
  <p>Adults are a bright metallic green. Elytra are typically a darker green, but can also have copper hues. EAB is the only North American
    species of Agrilus with a bright red upper abdomen when viewed with the wings and elytra spread.
  The species also has a small spine found at the tip of the abdomen and serrate antennae that begin at the fourth antennal segment.
   The French priest and naturalist Armand David collected a specimen of the emerald ash borer during one of the trips he took through imperial
   China in the 1860s and 1870s. He found the beetle in Beijing and sent it back to France,
   where a brief description by the entomologist LÃ©on Fairmaire was published in the Revue d'Entomologie in 1888.</p>
  <h2>Quarantine and tree removal</h2>
  <p>Once an infestation is detected, quarantines are typically imposed by state or national government agencies disallowing transport of ash firewood or
    live plants outside of these areas without permits indicating the material has been inspected or treated (i.e., heat treatment or wood chipping)
    to ensure no live EAB are present in the bark and phloem. In urban areas, trees are often removed once an infestation is found to reduce EAB population densities and the likelihood of further spread.
    Urban ash are typically replaced with non-ash species such as maple, oak, or linden to limit food sources for EAB.
    In rural areas, trees can be harvested for lumber or firewood to reduce ash stand density,
    but quarantines may apply for this material, especially in areas where the material could be infested.</p>
